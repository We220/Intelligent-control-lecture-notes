Action selection - Doing the right thing at the right time
Production is a tuple (sensory precondition, action)
Production system set of productions use dto solve a particular problem

Markov assumption
	Holds when each context uniquely determines an action
	Memory can help (Has a big impact on expectations and perceptions)

Want optimality from action selection (Most optimal plan)
But this is impossible - Satisficing is better (The most satisfactory one)

Situation = snapshot of the world
Fluients - true or false statements in a given situation
Action maps situations to situations
Function to transistion world from one state to the next

Influential representation for actions
	Preconditions
	Delete list
	Add list
	Add and delete list together are the action

All AI need designs

Primitive facts persist between states
Inferred facts not carried over and must be re-inferred
Inefficient is difference between formal planning and reactive systems AI

Sussman anomaly - Pursing a goal directly causes you to become stuck (Blocks on a table example)

Forward chaining - start from world look for goal
Backward chaining - Start at goal look back for current world
Combine to limit combinatorics
Affordances - perceptual system delivers set of possible actions with object ID (Sit on a chair, grab something)

Robust behaviour - work well in variety of situations
Brittle behaviour - fails immediately (Specific)
Graceful degredation - Won't perform as well as normal but should do something (Don't just fail)

Describing world in ways that can be sensed is the hard part

Reactive/Dynamic planning
Means action selection by look up
Plans used as communication
Need to be adaptable to the unseen
Methods of Dynamic planning 
	Environmental Determinism
	Finite state machines
	Basic reactive plans

Don't specify actions that the world will take itself (Transistions)
Focus on intentional goals need to handle contingencies

Basic reactive plans
	Prioritised list of actions converging to a goal. Guarded by enivronmental context requirement
	STRIPS triangle table is an example of this
	Exploit representations and insights of earlier AI planning (Preconditions)
	Reactive - pre-programmed little real time search

Learning plans
Learn by observation
	Create Markov model of knowlegeable agent actions
	Markov model used as reactive planned
