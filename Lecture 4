Cognitive architechtures
	What kinds of parts does the system need
		Ontology
	How should parts be put together
		Development methodology
	How is the whole thing arranged
		Architecture

Can be multiple cognitive architectures (oxymoron)
People looking for generic plan for building real AI
Used to be popular research area not so much now
Evolutionary history tells us about what worked and didn't

Past doesn't predict the future for AI
Hardware changes change what is possible

How do you bias/constrain/focus cognition so it works (real time planning  or machine learning)
	Where do you put sensors/what do they need to know

Sensing to action (Associative learning)
	Basic component of intelligence
	Problem is search need arbitration mechanism

Architecture needs action from perception and further structure to combat combinatorics
Needs productions and problem spaces, real time is hard
Goal ordering needs to be flexible
Structured dynamic plans make it easier to get your robot to do complext stuff
Automated planning not used often
To facilitate automated palnning modularity often compromised
Maybe you don't want productions as basic representation (May want to come between sense and act)
Architecture looks different if you worry about human linguistic/literature behaviour rather than making something work
Talk about architecture for a system now (Specific robots)

Expert systems allow choice of policies (non work perfectly)
	recency - What you used recently use it
	utility - Keep track of what was used before and if it was successful (May not be good in things that only need to be used once in a while) 
	random
	Use a combination of them
	Encode knowledge of domain expert as productions replace with AI
	Hype in 80's but they were a failure
	Still exist in certain use cases - Circuit board checking, fraud
	Issue was experts don't know why they do what they do, report novice knowledge
	Often do what they were told to do (e.g. Language) don't realise how you have become skilled
	Swiss cheese man example used smell

SOAR
	Breaks the productions into sub-goals (Problem space)
	Multiple things at the same time - impass
	Reason about what to do
	Productions work on predicate database
	If more than one declare an impasse reason what to do
	Remember the resolution as a chunk
	Wanted to learn like a child does
	Nobody wanted it, had a large overhead
	Military use it for combat situations for strategy
	Dealing with time was hard had to change lots of things - fixed action patterns in nature

ACT-R
	Thought they could solve everything by using bayesian
	Couldn't get it to work without problem spaces from other solutions
	Tried to fix SOAR
	Easier to use
	Models how children learn arithmetic
	Logical and bayesian system to solve arbitration problem
	Utility - implicit knowledge
	Logic - explicit knowledge



General problem solver
	Seperated specific problem from reasoning system
	SOAR was the next try

Spreading activation networks
	Inputs you see and that are goals, chains of things that you can do
	Picks what is the current goal
	The box with the most amount of activation gets done
	different factors will impact what gets done
	Doesn't work
	More than two steps no convergence, can't do full action selection
Tyrell extension
	Consider all info and all actions at all times (miss something)
	Favor consumatory actions by weighting and weight uncertainty
	Too many parameters

Subsumption
	Used in gengis
	Emphasis on sensing to action
	Each FSM (Finite state machine) is a behaviour
	Complex distributed arbitration
	No learning
	Worked
Action from perception can provide further structure (Modules (Behaviour))
Modules support iterative development
Real time should be a core organising principle
Good ideas can carry bad ideas a long way (No learning, hard action selection)

Layered or Hybrid architectures
Incorporate behaviours as smart primitives
Use hierarchical dynamic plans for behavior sequencing
(Allegedly) Some have automated planner to make plans for layer 2

BDI - Belief, Desires, Intentions
	Beliefs - predicates
	Desires - goals and related dynamic plans
	Intentions - current goal
	Responds to emergencies
	Reactive, not meant to be used all the time

CogAff
	Reflection on top
	Reflexes
	Sense and action separated
	Heirarchy in action selection, goal swapping
	Gap in our brains between sensing and action - Don't do the first thing we think of (Cognitive?)
