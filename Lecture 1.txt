Why human like
	Nature provided best examples of intelligence
	Problems of real time systems different from others that are less constrained (Google)
	Building these systems allows us to appreciate complexity and finess of nature

Spending concious cycles is not necessarily the hardest part of intelligent behaviour
Some problems solved for you or by you

Intelligence
	Judged by expressed behaviour, Judged by people or natural selection
	Do the right thing at the right time
	Different situations cause different levels of intelligence

Behaviour is the interaction between an agent and its environment
Components - Morphology (Shape), Sensing, Action reflexes/Motor skills, Cognition (Real time search)

Trade-offs in making a robot intelligent, requires a combination of all components to varying degrees
