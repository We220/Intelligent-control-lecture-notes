Simulations, Agents and Science

Simulation
	They describe the problem
	Simpler than real world, so simpler AI as working off of a simulation
	Complexity of intelligence is a reflection of complexity of the world (Emergence from interaction)
	Responding to the complex world makes you look complex

Response to simulation critique
	No longer bespoke, harder to cheat (More general)
	Robots have less input and output mechanisms than natural intelligence, so are simpler
	Review the environment (simulation) as well as the robot (intelligence)
	Game AI built for graphics and engagement

Agents
	Animal or animat(new AI) (Agent to discriminate between robot and animal)
	Module of a program treated anthropomorphically (Communicates to other parts via language, has beliefs, goals)
	Simple entity representing an individual

Actually comes from philosophy, anything that facilitates change (Not intelligence)
Implies responsibility and intentionality (Authority)
Principle agent problem - Can you align the rewards for the agents so the agents interests align with yours (Prevent corruption)

New AI
ABM - Agent based modelling (Operations research, how you run a buisness)
MAS - Multi-agent systems
Small overlap between these but not much

Simulations as science
	Simulation is a hypothesis, described so it can be run on a computer
	Described so completely it can be run on a computer
	Consequences of model assessed by sampling
	Model behaviour compared to target systems using standard hypothesis testing
	Output of model not data about the world
	Data about the hypothesis or predictions of the hypothesis
	One form of modelling
	Other forms that have been around longer (Differential equations)

Map of Germany problem
	A map of Germany that leaves out no details will be the size of Germany

Agent based modelling
	Describe environment
	Specify behaviour of individuals
	See if consequences of individuals acting in the environment are what you predicted

Build a model from intuition and then someone else or you simplifies it
Simplicity/accuracy tradeoff
Theory building is essential step of science
Process of building simulation can uncover flaws in a model

Flocking (Boids)
	Separation - avoid crowding local flockmates (Too close move away)
	Alignment - Steer towards average heading of local flockmates (Travel in same direction)
	Cohesion - Move towards average position of local flockmates (If you are far away move towards the rest)
 zor - zone of repulsion
 zoo - zone of orientation
 zoa - zone of attraction 

Baldwin Effect
	"Effect through which an initially learned response to the environmental change evolves a genetic basis"
	Info can't pass into genome directly
	Learning indirectly accelerates evolution
	Impacts fitness of individual
	Therefore increase or decrease fitness difference between genotypes
	This will then accelerate or decelerate rate of genetic change
	Phenotypic plasticity - learning
	Traits that affect this are selected
	Change fitness landscape, learning more likely at a different fitness

Simulations run risk you've guessed incorrectly on the problem description
Scientific theories include both problem description and solution
