Scientific simulation and social structures

Science branch of philosophy concerned with explanation
Science explanations are checked by comparison to data (From the world)
	Gathering data and also building explanations (Theory)

Ultimate - Why the robots that turned right survive
	Function - Lived due to what it did (Run away from loud noise)
	Phylogeny - History of why it turns right (Egg to person), (How you got to run away legs)
Proximate - Why did the robot turn right
	Causation
	Development
Proximate and ultimate describe different things

Unexpected result causes people to try and replicate it
	If you can't doubt on original result (Done something wrong, not communicated well enough)
	Succeed can get further evidence and test then extend the theory (Progression)

simulation show if a Parsimonious model could explain the data
	Increasing certainty not absolute
Goals of replication
	Validate experiment
	Extend results
		Explain more data
		Understand model better

Cognitive minimalism
Egalitarian - Challenging someone that insults you
bilateral aggression - fighting over it
human-like reconciliation - Making up afterwards
	Is this a cognitive strategy in monkeys
	If not maybe it isn't one in use either

Better quantitative data for monkeys than humans
	Complete interaction statistics
	Not significantly affected by observers

Despotic - violent infrequent conflict, strict dominance hierarchy, don't talk back
Egalitarian - more fights, but less violent

Two theories of why there are differences
	Migrate to an area with less resources, more violence, pressure for social structure (Hemelrijk)
	Evolved conflict resolution behaviour, less violence, less pressure for social structure (Flack and de Waal)

Hemelrijk model
	Simple
	differences attributed to greater variation in dominance rank in despotic
	This is due to aggression level increasing (Vicious fights)
	Side effect - dominants in centre of troop, subordinates outside (Convergent evidence)
Challenges
	Researchers working with monkeys thought something cognitive going on
	Justification for complex model is to better match data
	Do a replication
	Two were done
Replications found problems with the model
	Predicts too much dominance volatility
	Inverts observed female violence
	More complex model justified

Analysis methodology
	Understand model
	Find assumptions
	Treat assumptions as data
	Test predictions against data

AI simulation is a method of doing science
	Has to be checked against the real world data
Can be a source of evidence for a theory
